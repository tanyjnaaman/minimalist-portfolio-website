6. Change URL in [package.json](./package.json) file:

   ```json
    "homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/home"
   ```

   Or for deployment at custom domain, refer [create-react-app.dev](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#step-1-add-homepage-to-packagejson)

7. After editing run the following bash commands:

    - Navigate to the "public" folder.  
    - There you will see "social-image.png".  
    - Delete it.   
    - Take a screenshot of your version and rename it "social-image.png" and place it there.  
    
   Next time if you make changes, repeat from step 8.
