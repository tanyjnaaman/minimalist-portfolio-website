It had been a pretty good day actually - development was going well and we had a good amount of momentum going. I also recall that it was the third round of ModReg - for the uninitiated, ModReg is the module registration system at NUS, and having 0 modules registered in the third round usually spells death - and it was the exact situation I was in, given that I had now been newly promoted to a Computer Science major.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":19},"end":{"line":6,"column":517,"offset":770},"indent":[1,1]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":19},"end":{"line":6,"column":517,"offset":770},"indent":[1,1]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"But, as I would learn is a very common thing in the School of Computing, I reached out to what might as well be the fairy godmother of all of us - Ms Toh Mui Kiat, and she sorted me out with some of the most important fundamental classes in CS - OOP, Discrete Structures, Computer Organization, Probability and Statistics - all classes I would come to love (and hate at times).","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":772},"end":{"line":8,"column":378,"offset":1149},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":772},"end":{"line":8,"column":378,"offset":1149},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"That semester would begin what has been the very wild, often times wonderful, but equally frequently emotionally, mentally and physically challenging journey that I have been on for the last two years.

Back in 2019, I matriculated as a double degree student in mechanical engineering and economics. Why mechanical engineering? Well, it was sorta related to why economics as well. In much of my teens, I - and I suspect a good number of my peers at the time, too - was very idealistic and going through my own struggles with my health and in school. And this idealism manifested itself as a deep desire to do something somehow so great that it would outshine all of the things I had thought of as my failures and my points of shame. In particular, I had settled on the decision to enter the civil service, and so I thought covering my bases in mechanical engineering and economics would make me this special individual.","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":1465},"end":{"line":14,"column":773,"offset":2237},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":1465},"end":{"line":14,"column":773,"offset":2237},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"It was not quite meant to be though, and cracks started to show even before I began school.
