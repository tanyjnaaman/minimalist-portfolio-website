It had been a pretty good day actually - development was going well and we had a good amount of momentum going. I also recall that it was the third round of ModReg - for the uninitiated, ModReg is the module registration system at NUS, and having 0 modules registered in the third round usually spells death - and it was the exact situation I was in, given that I had now been newly promoted to a Computer Science major.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":19},"end":{"line":6,"column":517,"offset":770}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":19},"end":{"line":6,"column":517,"offset":770}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"But, as I would learn is a very common thing in the School of Computing, I reached out to what might as well be the fairy godmother of all of us - Ms Toh Mui Kiat, and she sorted me out with some of the most important fundamental classes in CS - OOP, Discrete Structures, Computer Organization, Probability and Statistics - all classes I would come to love (and hate at times).","position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":772},"end":{"line":8,"column":378,"offset":1149}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":8,"column":1,"offset":772},"end":{"line":8,"column":378,"offset":1149}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"That semester would begin what has been the very wild, often times wonderful, but equally frequently emotionally, mentally and physically challenging journey that I have been on for the last two years.
