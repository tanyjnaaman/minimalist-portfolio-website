I got an email from the School of Computing, indicating that my\napplication to transfer my course of study to Computer Science had been successful. I distinctly recall the moment -\nI was at the robotics lab with my team, working on the gimbal mechanism for the Standard Robot. It had been a pretty good day actually - development was going well and we had a good amount of momentum going. I also recall that it was the third round of ModReg - for the uninitiated, ModReg is the module registration system at NUS, and having 0 modules registered in the third round usually spells death - and it was the exact situation I was in, given that I had now been newly promoted to a Computer Science major.</p>\n<p>But, as I would learn is a very common thing in the School of Computing, I reached out to what might as well be the fairy godmother of all of us - Ms Toh Mui Kiat, and she sorted me out with some of the most important fundamental classes in CS - OOP, Discrete Structures, Computer Organization, Probability and Statistics - all classes I would come to love (and hate at times).</p>\n<p>That semester would begin what has been the very wild, often times wonderful, but equally frequently emotionally, mentally and physically challenging journey that I have been on for the last two years. But itâ€™s been a good two years, and I figured I want to reflect on it.</p>\n<h2>Why I joined mechanical engineering</h2>\n<p>We have to go further back than two years ago for this. Back in 2019, I matriculated as a double degree student in mechanical engineering and economics. Why mechanical engineering? Well, it was sorta related to why economics as well. In much of my teens, I - and I suspect a good number of my peers at the time, too - was very idealistic and going through my own struggles with school.</p>"}
