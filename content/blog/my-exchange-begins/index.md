## Pre flight

In the last month, I've spent so much time trying to meet and spend time with people I care about. Friends, family, extended family. I've typically been incredibly introverted, so this has been quite an... interesting and refreshing experience. In fact, in the last three weeks, my daily routine has basically been lunch with someone, run some errands, dinner with someone, sleep, repeat. This month has also coincided with the Lunar New Year, so I've also visited family and gone to Malaysia to visit my family there. It's been so busy. 

But it's been so good! So many of these friends I've not seen in a while - we're all busy, and myself, every since university has started, I can't say I've really had any lull periods other than this month. So it's been nice to spend time and catch up with many of these friends who I care for very deeply, and spend some time on myself recharging and reflecting. 

And here I am now, on the cusp on another great adventure. I'm kinda nervous, kinda excited. It's 12.53pm as I write this, and I'm more or less packed, set to have dinner with two close friends and then off I am on a flight to Zurich. 

It probably feels like a bigger deal than it is because many of my friends are graduating before I am (they study 4 years, I study 5) and are going abroad for grad school - so for many of them I won't see for maybe a year and a half or so, maybe more. I'm happy and excited for all of these people - they are talented, intelligent and down-to-earth people who will do great things; I'll just miss them, is all. And I think I'll look back on and occasionally miss the simpler times. After all, in year 1 and 2 of university, everyone stayed on campus, hung out regularly, and the greatest worry we had were our grades. 

When I'm back, a lot of things will be different, I think. I'd have completed a semester at ETH, worked at Palantir, most of my friends would be abroad and/or graduated, and I imagine I, too, would have seen some change and growth. I'm equally scared and excited. 

11 more hours till I'm on that plane.

## First three days

So far, Zurich is: 
- very cold
- very friendly
- very expensive

I like it here. People are nice, public transport is great, I generally feel safe. The city centre is beautiful. 

The last 24 hours have been focused on **buying stuff**, because god, my room was really barebones, and there's so much minute overhead to just living, lol. Been to Ikea and carried a bunch of stuff back, been to a couple supermarkets and done the same, and I'm almost done. Just left with some small quality-of-life purchases like a drying rack. 

Day 1: landed, got a SIM card, rail pass, checked in, bought some groceries, went to ikea, made some friends. 

Day 2: went to the city centre with some friends, spent a ton of time walking around, had sandwich, some famous hot chocolate, saw a cool church and some great views of the river, hit a big supermarket, and cooked my first meal. Made more friends. 

Day 3: chatted with new people over breakfast. Went to the city centre for a tour. Made friends with people on said tour, and spent basically the whole day with them. Went back, made dinner (very bad yakisoba attempt, it's so hard without the right ingredients ._.), had some nice conversations and made more new friends. 

I'm so tired, but so far, so good. I hope I'll continue to make friends and do cool things. Tomorrow, is my first German class. Fingers crossed!

### The 14th day

As I write this, I have been on Swiss soil for 14 days now. Life is going pretty well - I've settled in quite nicely I think. It's gone by _quick_ though. In the last week or so I've completed German 1 (it's 3 x 2 hours a day, every day) which fulfils the first half of A1 German, climbed my first hill (the Swiss call it a molehill, but to my Singaporean mind the hike was tall), cooked my first rack of lamb for valentine's day (my girlfriend was kind enough to visit me from London), watched my first movie abroad (Swiss tickets are 17 CHF, and they have intermissions!) and got very cold a lot of the time. 

It's been very good, but very exhausting. Moving abroad and setting up a comfortable (if temporary) "home", doing 6 hours of high-intensity language learning daily and packing my schedule to spend time with my girlfriend while she's visiting is pretty tough. Switzerland is beautiful though, and people here are generally very welcoming. And thank god for the fact that most people speak English - I'd have such a tough time otherwise.     

Today in particular, my girlfriend has headed back to London, and I'm alone here. In the coming week, it's a bunch of admin and welcome events, the start of lessons and presumably a bunch of socializing and a return to using my brain after a month-long break. I'm really looking forward to it.

This year feels like it's shaping up to be a pretty good year, and I have a lot of things to look forward to. Fingers crossed next week is a good week, too.
