description: "Excited, but nervous."

In the last month, I've spent so much time trying to meet and spend time with people I care about. Friends, family, extended family. I've typically been incredibly introverted, so this has been quite an... interesting and refreshing experience. In fact, in the last three weeks, my daily routine has basically been lunch with someone, run some errands, dinner with someone, sleep, repeat. This month has also coincided with the Lunar New Year, so I've also visited family and gone to Malaysia to visit my family there. It's been so busy. 

But it's been so good! So many of these friends I've not seen in a while - we're all busy, and myself, every since university has started, I can't say I've really had any lull periods other than this month. So it's been nice to spend time and catch up with many of these friends who I care for very deeply, and spend some time on myself recharging and reflecting. 

And here I am now, on the cusp on another great adventure. I'm kinda nervous, kinda excited. It's 12.53pm as I write this, and I'm more or less packed, set to have dinner with two close friends and then off I am on a flight to Zurich. 

It probably feels like a bigger deal than it is because many of my friends are graduating before I am (they study 4 years, I study 5) and are going abroad for grad school - so for many of them I won't see for maybe a year and a half or so, maybe more. I'm happy and excited for all of these people - they are talented, intelligent and down-to-earth people who will do great things; I'll just miss them, is all. And I think I'll look back on and occasionally miss the simpler times. After all, in year 1 and 2 of university, everyone stayed on campus, hung out regularly, and the greatest worry we had were our grades. 

When I'm back, a lot of things will be different, I think. I'd have completed a semester at ETH, worked at Palantir, most of my friends would be abroad and/or graduated, and I imagine I, too, would have seen some change and growth. I'm equally scared and excited. 

11 more hours till I'm on that plane.
