description: "So, I've decided to drop my second degree in economics."
---

It's a funny thing studying a double degree.  Opening conversations often include a moment of confusion when they realize I'm in my fourth year, but also somehow still not graduating. You can almost see them trying to work out if some weird combination of NS, poly/JC/international school could somehow have led to this (you know that meme with the lady calculating stuff in her head?). Sometimes I also throw in the fact that I'm 23 (I'm male, and did not do NS, for context) just to see how they react, and sometimes it's pretty funny. I've always laughed it off though, because it's just a funny quirk of doing a double degree. 

Today, though, I made a new acquaintance. And for the first time in four years, my explanation was simply that I'm taking a little longer to graduate. It feels strange. 

### Why I wanted a second degree in economics

The first line on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics) defines the field to be "a social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services." 

I agree more with the second line, though - "Economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work." 

I've always understood Economics to be the study of how things interact at scale. Micro, macro and metrics are the umbrella fields that respectively study how systems operate at the level of *markets*, how they do so at the level of *economies* (many markets aggregated) and how we can confirm these theories empirically.  Utility maximisation, risk sharing schemes, game theory, the 134807340 regressions we learn - are all just different ways of trying to understand why people behave the way they do. And for that reason, I find economics fascinating and comforting, because it serves as my lens to understand what often feels like a very chaotic world. 

But beyond understanding how things worked for its practicalities, I also wanted to study economics to understand how the systems around me worked and failed. At 18, it felt like a lot of things were wrong with the world and I wanted to do my part fixing it. I felt like I had the drive and energy to do something good, in no small part probably fueled by youthful idealism. But also, at the *young* age of 18, the world felt noisy, chaotic and overwhelming, and I wanted a way to study it systematically. Coming across economics at JC felt exactly like what I wanted.

My big dream at the time was to study everything, be good at all of it, join the public service, and do some good work. It should be obvious now that that plan did not quite materialize (and for the record, most 18-year-old plans probably don't). But my plan was my plan, and off I was to university.


### Four years has flown by, and I'm not quite an economics student

If I look back honestly, though, I haven't really been an economics student. In my time at NUS, I've taken 47 courses. Only 9 of which have been economics-specific. If you count the math modules, that's another 3 classes. So that's a total of 12. They are: 

* EC1101E Introduction to economic analysis
* EC2101 Microeconomics 1
* EC2102 Macroeconomics 1
* EC2204 Accounting for economists
* EC3101 Microeconomics 2
* EC3102 Macroeconomics 2
* EC3303 Econometrics 1
* EC3304 Econometrics 2
* EC3333 Financial economics 1
  
In comparison, I've taken 8 (11 if you count math) mechanical engineering classes, and a whopping 17 CS courses (21 if you count math). Looking that way, it's hard to call myself a *double degree* student, right? 

And looking at my semester schedules in the last four years, it becomes apparent to me that I've very slowly - like the frog that boils in gradually-getting-hotter water without realizing - been letting go of that pipe dream of being a civil servant that did some really good and meaningful work. I've invested most of my time and energies studying computer science - a field that deeply and genuinely fascinates me, to the degree that even when it brings me (at times deep) emotional distress I find a way to enjoy it. To say that I've decided to drop my pursuit of a degree in economics isn't quite accurate, because if you look at what I did and not what I or my records said, I was never serious in this pursuit anyway. 

That said, 9 courses is not something to laugh at - it's enough to complete a second major in economics after all. And I'd like to think I've studied enough of it to at least not sound like a complete idiot to the average person (but I probably would sound like an idiot to any real economist out there). 

### It's time to move on, I think

Anyone who hears me talk about my work these days will probably hear a lot about machine learning, backend engineering, something I'm working on in my research, some cool algorithm or theorem or proof I came across. It is very unlikely one would hear me talk about anything I learnt in economics. And perhaps that's precisely reflective of where I'm at these days. 

Studying economics has not been a mistake - I feel enriched, the world looks ever-so-slightly different. But only just, and only trivially so, because everything I've learnt has been theoretical.  And just as I've completed my core courses and reached the "promised land" of doing "real" economics courses (e.g. transport economics, urban economics, etc.), I find myself unable to make the necessary sacrifices in pursuit of them. And that's okay, I think. 

What sacrifices, one might ask? At its core, it's the decision to either take an extra semester to graduate - i.e. to graduate in 5.5 years. 

How does that work? I changed my course of study in the second semester of year 2. In 1.5 years, I had completed 32/160 MCs that would count towards my CS degree. In a year, most people complete 40, so I was 28 (7 courses) behind. In those 1.5 years, I had completed 36/120 MCs that would count towards my economics degree. In other words, In the remaining 3.5 years I had left to complete my double degree in 5 years, I had to complete *a lot* of classes, and do about 7-8 courses a semester. As of next semester, I have my honours thesis in CS and a 6-course mix of economics and random electives left to complete my degree. 

Anyone who has done FYP alongside multiple classes will probably attest to the fact that it's not easy. Now, add to that mix an offer to intern at Apple the coming semester, and they'll tell you that doing FYP while working full-time is suicide. I have arrived at the same conclusion. That leaves me with five or so choices, some of which are stupid: 

1. Do 2 mods (SU-able) + FYP while at Apple, do 4 mods + FYP in the last semester (basically suicide)
2. Do FYP while working at Apple, do 6 mods + FYP in the last semester (also basically suicide, and also half-assing everything)
3. Give up Apple, do 3 mods + FYP per semester (Apple??)
4. Give up my economics degree, do FYP while at Apple, but then FYP + 2 SU-able mods in the final semester 
5. Extend another semester and have it all

Reviewing these choices made it apparent to me that my second degree in economics no longer holds the place in my heart as it once did. It feels bittersweet, really - kinda that feeling you have when you realize you and your friend aren't as close as you used to be anymore, but it's probably for the better. 

A lot of this reflection came out of the general state of exhaustion I've been in for a while. A moment of clarity came to me last night when I realized that in the next 1.5 years, I had planned to: 

1. Study at ETH, do research there, and also my FYP remotely
2. Work at Palantir, study for my exams at ETH, and also my FYP remotely
3. Work at Apple, do my FYP, take 2 classes in the second half of the year
4. Finish my university life with 4 economics 4ks and my FYP

It felt like an insane plan that was also me half-assing everything, rather than whole-assing a few well-chosen things. So this feels like an important bit of calibration that's been coming for a long time anyway.

### What's next

As I write this, I'm actually back in Singapore for 2-3 weeks as the ligament I injured in Zurich heals, and I take care of some visa application stuff for my upcoming internship in London. This reflection has been a nice little break I've needed, and coming home has no doubt helped me with it. It also feels like a close to chapter of my life, but I think it's come at a good time, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll do good with what comes my way the rest of the year. 

If any of you would like a chat about reading a double degree, I'd love to, anytime :-).
